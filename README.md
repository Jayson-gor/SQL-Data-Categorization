# SQL-Data-Categorization
Efficiently Grouping Column Values
In database management, categorizing data efficiently is crucial for reporting and analysis. This guide provides a step-by-step solution for grouping numerical values into meaningful categories using SQL.

##  Objective
To categorize numeric values in a column by adding a new category field and updating it based on predefined conditions.

## Step 1: Adding a New Column
Before we categorize the data, we first need to add the CATEGORY column to the existing table.

## Step 2: Handling Data Type Challenges
When dealing with numeric columns, using SQLâ€™s LIKE operator can cause issues because it works best with string types (VARCHAR/NVARCHAR). A common solution is to cast the numeric column to a string before applying pattern matching.

## Step 3: Updating Column with Categorized Values
Use the following SQL script to populate the new CATEGORY column based on the values in the Code column:

## Best Practices
1. Always ensure data integrity before performing updates.
2. Consider indexing frequently queried columns for better performance.
3. Use VARCHAR conversions carefully to avoid implicit conversion overhead.

## Conclusion
By following this guide, you can efficiently categorize data based on numeric values, ensuring consistency and accuracy in reporting and analytics.
